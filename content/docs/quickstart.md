Get started with {{< reuse "/docs/snippets/kgateway.md" >}}, a cloud-native Layer 7 proxy that is based on the [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) and [{{< reuse "docs/snippets/k8s-gateway-api-name.md" >}}](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) projects.

## Before you begin

These quick start steps assume that you have a Kubernetes cluster, `kubectl`, and `helm` already set up. For quick testing, you can use [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

```sh
kind create cluster
```

## Install

The following steps get you started with a basic installation. For instructions, see the [installation guide](/docs/operations/install).

Good job! You now have the {{< reuse "/docs/snippets/kgateway.md" >}} control plane running in your cluster.

## Next steps

Ready to try out more features? Check out the following guides:

- [Install a sample app such as httpbin](../operations/sample-app/). This guide includes setting up an API gateway, configuring a basic HTTP listener on the API gateway, and routing traffic to httpbin by using an HTTPRoute resource.
- [Set up an API gateway with a listener](../setup/listeners/) so that you can start routing traffic to your apps.
